Computes seafloor landability map from hi-\/resolution bathymetry geo\+T\+I\+FF or X\+YZ non-\/gridded maps.

C++ based implementation for {\itshape Landing Area Detection} pipeline. Current requirements\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item G\+D\+AL for geo\+T\+I\+FF metadata parsing
\item Open\+CV for raster image processing (preferred over G\+D\+AL specifics)
\item C\+G\+AL for improved alpha\+Shape detection
\end{DoxyItemize}

G\+IS specific solutions does not provide a seamless connection between different pipeline modules. Q\+G\+IS plugins for S\+A\+GA, G\+D\+AL and G\+R\+A\+SS fail to provide interoperability. The goal is to provide a low-\/level C++ modular implementation, and -\/if necessary-\/ provides an interface with Q\+G\+IS via Python plugins w/\+QT.
